# Templates

Repository containing utility scripts for handling various aspects in a DL model training pipeline:
- Conversion to/from BIDS format to nnUnet or other ecosystem-specific formats;
- Script to train a model in a reproducible way (ie: fetch dataset of specific version, call MONAI functions, define Pytorch architecture with various parameters)

**Note**: For new scripts/functions, please create a folder with a suitable name and add them there.
